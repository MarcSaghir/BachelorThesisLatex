\section{Our own Dataset}
- repeat motivation why we added additional data in mvtec style
- say that we went with loco mvtec flair(maybe give reasons)
- say that we came up with a set of structural and logical anomalies for each category
- list categories(flat connector, angle and special construct)

- 3 sub sections for the three categories

- flat connector
- link the exact one we used(or examples of some)
- give structural anomalies
- give logical anomalies
- for both briefly touch on how we produced them
- show image examples for each

- repeat same for other categories

- also when describing angle:
- touch on how there is a special case with multi perspective detection


\section{pipeline}
- explain brief structure of the pipeline
- ???


\section{Ensemble network}
- network architecture
- specifics

\section{Different ensemble approaches}
