\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:experimentsetup}

All models trainings and result reproductions have been conducted on the IAD cluster student partition. The GPU in use for all nodes used by that partition (ist die formulierung gut?) is and 
RTX 2080Ti with 11GB of memory, and the CPU is an AMD Ryzen 9 16-Core processor. The cluster overview (verlinken) serves to provide further detail for additional questions. As for software, 
pytorch 2.1.2 was utilized to implement the ensemble model. The specifications of other libraries, as well as the specifications for the MVTecAD LOCO experiment are documented in the 
environment files in the project code.

The dataset category was recorded with a (felix nach infos fragen) camera, which was stationary mounted over a surface with a black cloth on it at a height of (felix fragen) centimeters. 
The lighting of the photoshoot was provided by a softbox(???) (felix f√ºr mehr infos fragen).
