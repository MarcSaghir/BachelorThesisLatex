\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:realconclusion}

- conclusion performance change of state of the art methods/current capabilities of detecting logical anomalies

- conclusion of flat connector as a class
-> was it challenging
-> were the results similar to other classes
-> were the anomalies picked well%(im bezug auf wie man weitere hätte machen können)

- conlusion of ensemble approach + pipeline
-> did it work
-> were the improvements significant/promising
-> current state of the pipeline




\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:finaloutlook}

- how to proceed with findings from survey
-> either here or below in ensemble section: mention idea of fusing patchcore and simplenet

- how to possibly extend/modify the flat connector class/LOCO dataset
-> different anomalies?
-> different logical rules with multiple objects?
-> new class ideas?
--> angle for multiperspective class
--> metal plate with screws

- how to improve the ensemble
-> experiment more with different backbones/other hierarchies of different backbones

-> ensemble as double black box

--> use another method to ensemble the feature maps
---> fix/replace PCA like mentioned in Discussion
---> other approach like learn with specialized ensembling network

--> find differnt kinds of feature representations and input them to the network
