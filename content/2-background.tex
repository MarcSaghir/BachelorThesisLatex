This is an algorithm 





\section{Classes of Anomaly detection}
- there are different kinds of approaches to IAD
- look at tree picture
 
- First important distinction is between supervised and unsupervised
-> we focus on unsupervised
-> list problems with supervised approaches and thus advantages of unsupervised ones

- briefly touch on other IAD settings like few shot, along with references

- among unsupervised approaches, there are two more fundamental distinctions
-> reconstruction based vs representation/feature embedding based
-> explain difference with lots of references

- for reconstruction based touch on 2-3 base categories like GANs etc and link fundamental papers for GANs etc
- for representation based important to explain memory bank, teacher student, and distribution map
- explain normalizing flow somehow somewhere in there

- maybe say which algos we chose and what we covered with that


\section{Our own Dataset}
- repeat motivation why we added additional data in mvtec style
- say that we went with loco mvtec flair(maybe give reasons)
- say that we came up with a set of structural and logical anomalies for each category
- list categories(flat connector, angle and special construct)

- 3 sub sections for the three categories

- flat connector
- link the exact one we used(or examples of some)
- give structural anomalies
- give logical anomalies
- for both briefly touch on how we produced them
- show image examples for each

- repeat same for other categories

- also when describing angle:
- touch on how there is a special case with multi perspective detection



\section{metrics}

- show metrics from survey papers
- explain which metrics we used and where the other ones are used
- explain also why we used the ones we used, and what disadvantages of other ones where

- touch on paul bergmann paper for sPRO score, say how it is better than pixel auroc and normal pro score, also explain saturation thresholds

- some math formula for calculating the important metrics
