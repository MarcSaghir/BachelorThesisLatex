This is an algorithm 





\section{Classes of Anomaly detection}
- there are different kinds of approaches to IAD
- look at tree picture
 
- First important distinction is between supervised and unsupervised
-> we focus on unsupervised
-> list problems with supervised approaches and thus advantages of unsupervised ones

- briefly touch on other IAD settings like few shot, along with references

- among unsupervised approaches, there are two more fundamental distinctions
-> reconstruction based vs representation/feature embedding based
-> explain difference with lots of references

- for reconstruction based touch on 2-3 base categories like GANs etc and link fundamental papers for GANs etc
- for representation based important to explain memory bank, teacher student, and distribution map
- explain normalizing flow somehow somewhere in there

- maybe say which algos we chose and what we covered with that



\section{The Datasets}

-- mvtec2d Dataset:
- cite bergmann papers
- very little Datasets
- hosrt description of mvtec dataset 
-> 15 Classes
-> grayscale masks
-> explain folder structure(maybe with image)
-> example images

-- mvtec LOCO Dataset
- introduced in beyond dents and scratches
- before there were only structural anomalous Datasets
- but to compare the ability of IAD methods for logical constraints, there needs to be another dataset -> neu formulieren damit es nicht nach copypasta aussieht

- short description of LOCO dataset



\section{metrics}

- show metrics from survey papers
- explain which metrics we used and where the other ones are used
- explain also why we used the ones we used, and what disadvantages of other ones where

- touch on paul bergmann paper for sPRO score, say how it is better than pixel auroc and normal pro score, also explain saturation thresholds

- some math formula for calculating the important metrics
